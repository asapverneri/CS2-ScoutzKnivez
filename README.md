## üéÆ CS2 ScoutzKnivez

This is a legendary gamemode made for CS2. It's in early state, but it should be pretty stable.
With this plugin, you only need maps where to play and it has English language ready to go.
This is intended to be a feature rich gamemode with many features already included in one plugin.
If you want to create translations or anything else, feel free to make a pull request!
I've made this for my future ScoutzKnivez server that I might create and I'll be working on this whenever I get some free time.
Tested on Windows for now, but should work with Linux aswell i guess.
